This project implements an end-to-end web application that delivers the core value
proposition of our midterm project idea, “금리변동 추적기 (RateWatcher).”

## 3. Project Summary

RateWatcher is a web application that helps users with variable-rate loans understand
how their interest rates may change in the future.

Given:
- The user’s current loan information (current rate, spread, reset period, etc.), and
- Market reference rates such as CD rate or COFIX,

the app estimates the **expected future interest rate at the next reset date**. This allows
users to:
- Anticipate payment increases when interest rates are rising, and
- Avoid unnecessary refinancing when rates are expected to fall.
